# C++ Modules - 42 School

Welcome to my C++ repository, where you can explore my journey through the C++ modules at 42. These modules are designed to introduce and strengthen Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C++, an extension of the C programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. Each module builds on the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of C++98.

## Module 00

**Topics Covered:**
- Namespaces
- Classes
- Member functions
- stdio streams
- Initialization lists
- Static members
- Const correctness

### Description
In this module, I delved into the basics of C++ programming, focusing on foundational concepts such as namespaces, classes, and member functions. I learned how to use standard I/O streams for input and output, as well as how to utilize initialization lists for efficient object construction. This module also introduced static members and the importance of const correctness in writing robust and error-free code.

## Module 01

**Topics Covered:**
- Memory allocation
- Pointers to members
- References
- Switch statement

### Description
Module 01 expanded my knowledge to dynamic memory management, an essential aspect of C++ programming. I explored how to allocate and deallocate memory using pointers and references, enhancing my understanding of memory safety and optimization. Additionally, this module introduced pointers to members and the use of the switch statement for controlling program flow.

## Module 02

**Topics Covered:**
- Ad-hoc polymorphism
- Operator overloading
- Orthodox Canonical Class Form (OCCF)

### Description
In Module 02, I learned about ad-hoc polymorphism and how to achieve it through operator overloading, allowing for more intuitive and readable code. This module also emphasized the Orthodox Canonical Class Form (OCCF), ensuring that my classes are well-defined, with proper constructors, destructors, copy constructors, and assignment operators.

## Module 03

**Topics Covered:**
- Inheritance

### Description
Module 03 introduced inheritance, a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming. I explored how to create a class hierarchy, enabling code reuse and the extension of existing classes. This module laid the groundwork for more advanced OOP techniques, setting the stage for polymorphism and dynamic binding.

### Learnings

#### Inheritance modes:
  - Public: will take over all public and protected members of base class
  - Protected: Public and Protected members will become protected
  - Private: they will both become private members

Private members of the base class are never inherited!
